    ``rspec spec/uniq_array.rb# for tests``


    ``tree.rb``

    ``rspec spec/tree_spec.rb #for tests``


    ``ruby gp_rating_breakdown.rb game_name``
    No specs for this one since it's too much hassle to emulate script run from rspec


    ``move_fast/index.html``
    
    html + js combos was used for this task. I decided to skip backend entirely, since there is no need for it. Pure js was used(no jQuery), this much faster, but code a bit blowned up.
    
    Also the reasoning behind width, length and height inputs were unclear to me, since they are not used in any calculation rules and can be removed safely from interface.
    
    There is also no "checks for dumb" for numbers/literlas on inputs, i thought this is beyond this task.
